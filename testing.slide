* Golang Testing Frameworks
- Unit testing
- BDD testing
- REST API testing
- Performance analysis

* Unit testing
- Standard `testing` package
- Helper tool `go-carpet`
- Extensions (`testify`)
- Alternative package `oglematchers`
- Combination of `ogletest` and `oglematchers`
- Package `assertions`

* BDD testing
- GoConvey
- Godog


* BDD testing
- Test pyramid
- BDD: behavior-driven development
- Simple DSL

* GoConvey

* Godog

* Gherkin language
- Feature/Scenario/Scenario Outline
- Given/when/then
- Variable parameters in tests
- Tables as data source
- Tables for multiple test runs with variable parameters

* Gherkin language
- Based on natural language + a few keywords
- usually English is used
- translated into other languages as well
- It is quite similar to Python, AsciiDoc etc.
- indentation
- based on keywords, not on special characters
- tables "drawn" in ASCII
- It is not tightly bound with any real programming language
- it can be used by non-developers

* Given-When-Then
- Semi-structured way to write down test cases

** Three clauses
- Given
- When
- Then

** The same clause on more consecutive lines?
- And

* Gherkin language - an example

    Given the customer has logged into their current account
      And the balance is shown to be 100 euros
     When the customer transfers 75 euros to their savings account
     Then the new current account balance should be 25 euros
